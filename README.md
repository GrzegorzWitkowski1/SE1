# Hitchhiking System API Documentation

## Introduction

This API allows users to manage hitchhiking rides, search for potential companions, rate hitchhiking spots, create events, and interact with emergency services. It supports user registration, profile management, ride posting, event participation, spot rating, achievement tracking, and more. The system is designed for scalability and performance, ensuring smooth interaction between users, events, and locations.

## Authentication

All API requests that require user identification must be authenticated using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Upon successful login, a JWT token is issued that must be included in the `Authorization` header for all protected endpoints.
