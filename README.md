# Hitchhiking System API Documentation

## Introduction

This API allows users to manage their hitchhiking trips, search for potential companions, rate spots, create events, and interact with emergency services. It supports user registration, profile management, trip posting, event participation, spot rating, and more. The system is designed for scalability and performance, ensuring smooth interaction between users, events, and locations.
